## Known Issues In the Original BASIC Code
 - If the computer moves a checker to the bottom row, it promotes, but
   leaves the original checker in place. (See line 1240)
 - Human players may move non-kings as if they were kings. (See lines 1590 to 1810)
 - Curious writing to "I" variable without ever reading it. (See lines 1700 and 1806)
