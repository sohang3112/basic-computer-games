### Craps

This game simulates the game of craps played according to standard Nevada craps table rules. That is:
1. A 7 or 11 on the first roll wins
2. A 2, 3, or 12 on the first roll loses
3. Any other number rolled becomes your “point.”
    - You continue to roll, if you get your point, you win.
    - If you roll a 7, you lose and the dice change hands when this happens.

This version of craps was modified by Steve North of Creative Computing. It is based on an original which appeared one day on a computer at DEC.
