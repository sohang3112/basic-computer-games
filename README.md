I have moved all the original BASIC source code into a folder for each project in the original book (first volume).

Note that Lyle Kopnicky has normalized all the code (thanks Lyle!) to run against [Vintage Basic](http://www.vintage-basic.net/download.html):

> I've included all the games here for your tinkering pleasure. I've tested and tweaked each one of them to make sure they'll run with Vintage BASIC, though you may see a few oddities. That's part of the fun of playing with BASIC: it never works quite the same on two machines. The games will play better if you keep CAPS LOCK on, as they were designed to be used with capital-letter input.
