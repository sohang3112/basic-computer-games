### 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe

3-D TIC-TAC-TOE is a game of tic-tac-toe in a 4x4x4 cube. You must get 4 markers in a row or diagonal along any 3-dimensional plane in order to win.

Each move is indicated by a 3-digit number (digits not separated by commas), with each digit between 1 and 4 inclusive. The digits indicate the level, column, and row, respectively, of the move. You can win if you play correctly; although, it is considerably more difficult than standard, two-dimensional 3x3 tic-tac-toe.

This version of 3-D TIC-TAC-TOE is from Dartmouth College.
